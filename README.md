# Fair Billing

## Description
A Python application to calculate fair billing based on session logs with unit tests, availble to run from docker and python directly. 

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine (for Docker run)
- Python installed on your machine (for direct run)

### External dependencies
- No external dependencies is needed.
- The empty file requirements.txt is created just for the project to be aware of Pythonâ€™s package management practices and to help point out that there are no extrnal dependcies used here.

## Running with Docker
### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LaithAlm/fair-billing.git
   cd fair-billing
```

2. **Build Docker Image:**
```sh
docker build -t fair-billing
```

3. **Run Tests:**
```sh
docker run fair-billing
```

4. **Create a Log Directory and Sample Log File (if not already in the cloned repo):**

```sh
mkdir -p logs
touch logs/sample_log.txt
```
Add the following content to logs/sample_log.txt:
```sh
14:02:03 ALICE99 Start
14:02:05 CHARLIE End
14:02:34 ALICE99 End
14:02:58 ALICE99 Start
14:03:02 CHARLIE Start
14:03:33 ALICE99 Start
14:03:35 ALICE99 End
14:03:37 CHARLIE End
14:04:05 ALICE99 End
14:04:23 ALICE99 End
14:04:41 CHARLIE Start
```

5. **Run Application:**
```sh
docker run -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs fair-billing python src/fair_billing.py /app/logs/sample_log.txt
```
6. **Check Output:**
The output should be:
ALICE99 4 240
CHARLIE 3 37


## Running Directly with Python
### Steps


1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fair-billing.git
cd fair-billing
```

2. **Run Application:**
- If you have Python 2 installed:
```sh
python src/fair_billing.py logs/sample_log.txt
```
You may wish to have the log file containing session logs as a different name or different place so amend it if you wish and then change the file path in the command.

- If you have Python 3 installed:
```sh
python3 src/fair_billing.py logs/sample_log.txt
```


The output should be:

```sh
ALICE99 4 240
CHARLIE 3 37
```

## Notes
- Ensure Docker is installed on your machine to build and run the Docker image.
- Ensure Python 3 is installed on your machine to run the application directly.
- The application reads a log file and calculates the total session time for each user.
- Invalid or irrelevant data in the log file is silently ignored.
